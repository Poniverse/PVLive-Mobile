Ponyville Live! Ionic/Cordova Mobile App
==========================

### Building

Install Node.js, then npm install Cordova and Ionic for working on Ionic app

Don't try to compile Android using Ionic ('ionic build android'), it doesn't support support multiDexEnabled in gradle build (as far as I can see).

Use 'cordova prepare android' (for Android) to build to Platforms folder; continue working there as needed in Android Studio

XCode/iOS instructions to come.
